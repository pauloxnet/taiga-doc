[[setup-taiga-scripts]]
Setup using **taiga-scripts**
-----------------------------

Introduction
~~~~~~~~~~~~

**taiga-scripts** primarily follows the standard installation process, but makes it more automatic. If
something goes wrong in the process, you should try to fix it by following the manual deploy process.

**taiga-scripts** always installs a specific (the most recent) version of Taiga (taiga-front and taiga-back)


Important notes about **taiga-scripts**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- In an alpha state, and has not been heavily tested in different environments.
- Designed to work with taiga-vagrant (see next section of this documentation).
- Does not support reprovisioning (updating) at this moment, that is still in development.
- Does not support installation with root user.
- The installation is not 100% ready for production.


Requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Freshly installed and updated Ubuntu 16.04
- Bash shell
- Git


Setup server-like environment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Make sure you have a fresh and updated Ubuntu 16.04 machine or virtual image:

[source, txt]
----
$ git clone https://github.com/taigaio/taiga-scripts.git
$ cd taiga-scripts
$ bash setup-server.sh
----


Setup development-like environment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This setup is much like the previous one but with a few differences:

- It does not install services like nginx, as they are only necessary for production
- It sets all hostnames to localhost to easily run everything on localhost

Make sure you have a fresh and updated Ubuntu 16.04 machine or virtual image:

[source, txt]
----
$ git clone https://github.com/taigaio/taiga-scripts.git
$ cd taiga-scripts
$ bash setup-devel.sh
----

Upgrade from Ubuntu 14.04 taiga installation to Ubuntu 16.04
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To upgrade from 14.04 to 16.04 you have to follow the official Ubuntu process:

[source, txt]
----
$ sudo apt-get install update-manager-core
$ sudo do-release-upgrade -p
----

Then you have to upgrade to the new postgres version maintaining the old data:
[source, txt]
----
$ sudo apt-get install -y postgresql-9.5 postgresql-contrib-9.5
$ sudo apt-get install -y postgresql-doc-9.5 postgresql-server-dev-9.5
$ sudo pg_dropcluster 9.5 main --stop
$ sudo pg_upgradecluster 9.3 main
$ sudo reboot
----

Then you have to use the circus service from ubuntu.
[source, txt]
----
$ pip uninstall circus pyzmq
$ apt-get install circus
$ cp ~/conf/circus.ini /etc/circus/circusd.conf
----

Rebuild your virtualenv
[source, txt]
----
$ rmvirtualenv taiga
$ mkvirtualenv taiga -p /usr/bin/python3.5
$ cd ~/taiga-back
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
----

Reboot the system
[source, txt]
----
$ sudo reboot
----

[[setup-taiga-vagrant]]
Setup using **taiga-vagrant**
-----------------------------

Introduction
~~~~~~~~~~~~

**taiga-vagrant** offers a Vagrantfile which makes it easy to turn on a fully provisioned
virtual machine. **taiga-vagrant** uses **taiga-scripts** for its provisioning scripts.


Important notes about using **taiga-vagrant**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- The installation is not 100% ready for production, it is designed for use as a demonstration.
- Does not support reprovisioning at this moment.

Dependencies
~~~~~~~~~~~~

- link:https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads[VirtualBox]
- link:http://downloads.vagrantup.com/[Vagrant]


Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~

[source, bash]
----
git clone https://github.com/taigaio/taiga-vagrant.git
cd taiga-vagrant
vagrant plugin install vagrant-vbguest
vagrant up
----

After installing, the Taiga service should be up and running. You can access it by going
to http://localhost:8000 with your browser.

You can use the following credentials to login to the recently created Taiga instance:

- Username: `admin`
- Password: `123123`

You can access the machine using ssh, if you would like to make some tweaks:

[source, bash]
----
vagrant ssh
----
